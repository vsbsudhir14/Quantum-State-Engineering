Abstract - Quantum State Engineering

Presented on November 5, 2022

In this term paper I discuss about the ways to engineer non-classical states of bosonic modes
by exploiting a coherent exchange of excitations with a two level system governed by the Jaynes-
Cummings model. The protocol aims to speed up the quantum adiabatic process by introducing
shortcuts to adiabaticity. The short evolution time makes sure that the protocol is resistant to
decoherence. I also discuss about the generation of Fock states, cat like states and photon shifted
states and their implementations in Ytterbium ion qubit.
